:earth_africa: Traveling is my passion. I have seen approximately 70 countries so far. Creating and discovering new things is my philosophy of life.

 ðŸ‘€ After studying economics and working in the banking sector for almost 11 years, I decided to pursue my career in photography and content creator.

:zap: My biggest goal is to use my skills and experience in the field of photography and design;
      to create from scratch a pleasing, unique and user-friendly method that aims to do something that has not been done before.
